Hi *,

I'm starting this blog to write about my current software projects. Currently these are mostly:
* **lrc-ai-assistant**: A plugin that uses LLMs to generate keywords, image title, caption and alt-text in Lightroom Classic.
* **lrc-immich-plugin**: This plugin enables you to export / publish Lightroom photo to Immich instances.

At the moment most of my efforts are concentrated on lrc-ai-assistant.
