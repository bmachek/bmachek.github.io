Hi *,

I'm starting this blog to write about my current software projects. Currently these are mostly:
* [lrc-ai-assistant]({% link _tabs/lrc-ai-assistant.md %}): A plugin that uses LLMs to generate keywords, image title, caption and alt-text in Lightroom Classic.
* [lrc-immich-plugin]({% link _tabs/lrc-immich-plugin.md %}): This plugin enables you to export / publish Lightroom photo to Immich instances.

At the moment most of my efforts are concentrated on lrc-ai-assistant.
