A Lightroom Classic plugin to fill **keywords**, **image title**, **caption** and **Alt Text** by using **ChatGPT**, **Gemini** or local **Ollama**. 
The project is under active development.

### Currently Available models
* **ChatGPT**:
  * gpt-4o-mini
  * gpt-4o
* **Gemini**:
  * 1.5 pro
  * 2.0 flash
  * 2.0 flash lite
  * 2.5 pro (experimental)
* **Ollama**
  * deepseek-r1
  * gemma3
  * llama3.2-vision
  * llava
  * mistral-small3.1

### Privacy and financial concerns
If your concerned about the privacy of your images, using Ollama maybe a good idea. 
This way no data is transferred externally.
Also the use of ChatGPT and/or Gemini on will generate costs.

## Usage
* Install plugin using Lightroom addon module manager.
* Obtain an API key for the model you want to use or install Ollama:
  * [Obtain Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
  * [Obtain ChatGPT API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  * [Download & Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
* Configure API key in Lightroom module manager. (Not needed for Ollama.)
* Choose the model you want to use on the Lightroom module manager.
  * If you use Ollama, you have to pull the selected model before first use, e.g. **ollama pull gemma3** or **ollama pull llama3.2-vision**
* Go to Library in Lightroom
* Select some photos
* Go to menu -> Library -> Addon Modules -> Analyze photo(s) with AI
* If enabled a preflight dialogs pops up, where the settings for the batch run can be set/verified.
* Also if enabled, a photo context dialog pops up for every photo, with a preview of the image and a text box to enter additional information for the specific image.
* If enabled review before save for title, caption or Alt Text and the field is already filled with data, a review dialog will show up. There is not (yet) a dialog for reviewing keywords.
* Wait it to fill your keywords, caption, title and Alt Text as selected.
* The plugin is designed to stop only on fatal errors.

## Notes
* All generated keywords are hierarchically beneath a top keyword "Google Gemini", "ChatGPT" or "Ollama". The hierarchy beyond can be edited in "Library -> Addon Modules -> Edit Keyword Categories".
  You can easily remove all keywords generated by the plugin, by deleting the top keyword in Lightroom's keyword list.
  Additionally you can create smart collections with filters for top keyword to keep track of photos that have or haven't been analyzed yet.
* Feel free to open issues or discussions. Any feedback is welcome.
