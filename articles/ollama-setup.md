### Download and Install Ollama
Download the current version for your platform: [HERE](https://ollama.com/download)

There's a standard installer package for each platform.

### After the installation
Once the installation procedure is complete, it's time to pull the LLM you considering to use.
Most LLM are multiple gigabytes big so the download will take some time, depending on your internet connection.

Open a Terminal and run **at least one** of the following commands.
```
ollama pull gemma3
```
```
ollama pull llama3.2-vision
```
```
ollama pull deepseek-r1
```
```
ollama pull llava
```
```
ollama pull mistral-small3.1
```
